            <p>The first settlers came into American Falls and founded the town in 1800. The town got its name from a group of American trappers whose boat went over the falls. The town originally was settled on the opposite side of the river to where it currently stands today. American Falls is also the first town in U.S. history to ever be completely moved elsewhere in 1888.</p>

            <p>The town of American Falls not only moved locations once but twice. In 1925 the Bureau of Reclamation started moving the town as it started the process of building a dam which would make the reservoir that is there today. The process overall was quite daunting becasue buildings were not only moved but sorted into three destination spots based upon the quality of each structure. You can still see the stack of the old flour mill sticking up out of the water as a monumental reminder to the residents of what used to be.</p>

            <p>During the relocation and development of the town, city developers ensured that the towns streets would run parallel to the reservoir and not on a North, South type basis. Frustrated by this many towns people disputed these plans and in response the city planners said that they situated the town in such a way so that the sun could shine in every window, hence the towns motto.</p>

            <p>The unique location of American Falls has brought in more people over the years. The Snake river and the American Falls reservoir offers opportunities for lots of farming due to the rich soil that is produced as a result. Locals as well as tourists come to fish, swim and boat in the reservoir during the warmer months and sometimes even during the winter. Also because of its unique location in the Magic Valley, American Falls typically has more milder winters compared to other areas in the state and regions roundabout.</p>

            <p>The Magic Valley and more specifically, American Falls, has seen significant growth within the last few years with big factories and companies coming in to support the growth in farming. Farming and in turn production of goods from locally grown products is a big source of income and growth in this area. More jobs have necessitaed the need for more people to move into the area thus the need for more homes and businesses to be built and to come into the area.</p>
