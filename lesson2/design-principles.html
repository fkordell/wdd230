            <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
            <h4>Apple</h4>

            <p>The Apple website makes good use of its whitespace by not cluttering every inch of the website with content. Overall they have a clean design by making good use of space, and not using too many distracting elements. The design grabs the users eye enough to instill a good amount of of pull.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>

            </picture>
            <p>The Amazon website does a really good job of aligning all of their content on the webb page. Alignment properties makes things look really uniform and easy to look at. On the offhand though, they almost pump too much content which makes things feel a little busy and claustrophobic.</p>

            <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
            <h4>Uber</h4>

            <p>The Uber website does a really good job of following Hick's law by getting straight to the point and making its purpose very straightforward and clear to the user. What makes it nice is they don't give the user too much too look at or choose from. You literally can choose to download the app and go from there, or input your location and desired destination to get a quick price quote.  </p>
