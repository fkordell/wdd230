            <p>The first settlers came into American Falls and founded the town in 1800. The town got its name from a group of American trappers whose boat went over the falls. The town originally was settled on the opposite side of the river to where it currently stands today. American Falls is also the first town in U.S. history to ever be completely moved elsewhere in 1888.</p>

            <p>The town of American Falls not only moved locations once but twice. In 1925 the Bureau of Reclamation started moving the town as it started the process of building a dam which would make the reservoir that is there today. The process overall was quite daunting becasue buildings were not only moved but sorted into three destination spots based upon the quality of each structure.</p>

            <p>During the relocation and development of the town, city developers ensured that the towns streets would run parallel to the reservoir and not on a North, South tpe basis. Frustrated by this many towns people disputed these plans and in response the city planners said that they situated the town in such a way so that the sun could shine in every window, hence the towns motto.</p>
